# PS2_Controller
Requirements:  
Implement a PS2 keyboard controller. It must read from a keyboard and display the characters on the 7-
segment displays . Only 8 characters will be displayed on the board and certain keys will have special 
roles. The enter will start a new line by resetting the displays. The position of the dot will be changed 
with the arrows. The backspace will delete the last character. If the dot is not on the last position the 
backspace deletes the character before the dot.
